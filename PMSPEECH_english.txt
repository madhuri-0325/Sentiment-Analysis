Our Ram has come after centuries of reply.Our Lord Ram has come after the unprecedented, patience, countless, sacrifice, sacrifice and penance of centuries.All of you all.Many congratulations to the countrymen.Our Ramlala will no longer live in the tent.Our Ramlala will stay in the divine temple right now.I have sure belief, it is immense reverence that what has been formed, it must be realized in the corner of the world, Ram devotees.This is supernatural, this moment is the highest, this atmosphere, this atmosphere, this energy, this clock of Lord Shri Ram, is a blessing on all of us.This sun of 22 January 2024 has brought 1 amazing aura.22 January 2024, written on the calendar.Not 1 date, these 1 new period is the origin of the affair.I also plead with Lord Shri Ram today.There must have been some lack of our efforts, our sacrifice, penance, that we could not do this work for so many centuries.Today the boat has been fulfilled.I believe Lord Ram, will definitely forgive us today.Even after the Constitution came into existence, a legal battle started for the existence of Lord Shri Ram for decades.I will express my gratitude.The judiciary of India, who has laid down justice, also built the temple of Prayas of justice in a manner in justice.Friends, today, in the village, village, there are 1 Kirtan Sankirtan.Today, festivals are being held in temples, cleanliness campaigns are being conducted.The whole country is celebrating Diwali today.This evening there is a preparation to ignite the house, house, Ram Jyoti.Yesterday I was at the beginning point of Ram Setu in Dhanoj Kodi with the blessings of Shri Ram.The Gadi Prabhu Rama who came out to cross the sea was 1 moment.It was my humble attempt to feel the moment in that feeling that had changed the Kaal Chakra.There I tied the flower there, there is 1 faith in me, as if the Kaal Chakra had changed at that time, in the same way, Kaal Chakra, then will change and grow in the auspicious direction.During my 11 -day fasting ritual, I tried to touch the feet of those places where the feet of Lord Rama, whether it is the Panchavati price of Nashik, the holy tripire temple of Karla, there is Lapakshi in Andhra Pradesh, Srirangam I RanganathThere should be Swami Temple, Sri Ramnath Swamy Temple or Dhanushkodi in Rameswaram.It is my good fortune that with this renovation, I got the opportunity to travel from Sagar to Saryu.From Sagar to Saryu, the same festival of Rama is overshadowed everywhere.That too was 1 time when some people used to say that if the Ram temple is built, the fire would be set.Such people could not know the sanctity of the social sentiment of India.The construction of this temple of Ram Lala is also a symbol of peace, patience, mutual, harmony and coordination of Indian society.We are seeing this construction is not giving any fire but giving rise to energy.The Ram temple has brought every section of the society to take inspiration to grow on the path of 1 bright future.I will call on those people today, let's feel, rethink your thinking.Ram is not fire, Ram is energy, Ram is not a dispute, Ram is a solution.Ram is not just ours, Ram belongs to everyone.Rama is not present, not just present, Ram is eternity.Friends, the way the whole world is associated with this event of Ram temple Pran Pratishtha is being seen in the way Ram temple is being seen in the bestness of Rama.As is the celebration in India, it is in many countries.Today, this festival of Ayodhya has also become a celebration of those global traditions of Ramayana.Ramlala's reputation is also a reputation of Vasudev's less, less idea.This temple is not just 1 Dev temple.This is the temple of Digardhana in India, of the vision of India, the philosophy of India.This is the temple of nation consciousness in the form of Rama.Rama is the faith of India, Ram is the basis of India, Ram is the idea of ​​India, Ram is the law of India, Ram is the consciousness of India, Ram is the thinking of India, Ram is the prestige of India, Ram is the glory of IndiaHai, Rama is influence, Ram is also a policy, Ram is also a policy, Ram is also a continuity, Rama is also continuity, Ram is Vibhu, Viva is wide, Ram is widespread, world is the world, faith is mother.And so when Rama's reputation, it does not affect it for years or centuries, it affects for thousands of years.The grand temple of Shri Ram has been built, now what is the use of use?The wait is over.Now what next?On this occasion today, the gods, the gods and souls who have appeared to bless us, will we see us like this?No, not at all.Today I am feeling with full holy heart, that Kaal Chakra is changing.It is a pleasant coincidence that our generation has been selected as the craftsman of the 1st time of oats.A thousand years later, generations will remember our today's works of nation building.That's why I say, this is the time, the right time.We have to lay the foundation of India for the next 1000 years from today, from this holy time.By moving beyond the construction of the temple, now all the countrymen take us to create the creation of this moment, capable, competent, grand, divine India.Rama's thoughts should be in the mind as well as in the public mind, this is the ladder of nation building.
